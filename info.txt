BEYOND THE CLASSROOM 
When I am not busy with my studies, I enjoy getting out and being active in any way I can. I grew up playing football and basketball, and while I no longer play for a school team, I still try to go play with my friends whenever I can. While I'm not playing pickup games, you can find me working out in the gym almost every day. Beyond loving to excercise, I also spend a lot of time keeping in touch with my friends and family. I do not get to see my three brothers and two sisters that often now that I am a student at Alabama, and maintaining a close relationship with them is extremely important to me. I also love to travel and try new things - I hope to learn to snowboard this winter! While just relaxing at home, I'm either playing acoustic guitar or simply chilling out and watching a movie.
That's me in a nutshell - please don't hesitate to contact me!
